Hi, my name is Son Tung Dang.

This is a project which I wrote. This file will provide the documents. I'm
writing the body of the text here. It contains an overall description of the
project. It might explain how to go about installing/compiling it. It might
provide a change-log for the code. [[linalg]] Maybe it will talk about the
history and/or motivation for this software.

@Note
You can include any notes (or bugs, warnings, or todos) like so.

@Bug
You can have multi-paragraph versions of these too! That means you can
include

- ordered lists
- unordered lists
- images
- etc.

@endbug

@Bug Hey I'm doing it again...
